<h2>6. Forgot About Dre</h2>
<h3>Artist: Dr. Dre featuring. Eminem</h3><br>
<h3>Album: 2001</h3><br>
<h3>Year Released: 1999</h3><br>
<p>"Forgot About Dre" is a song by American rapper Dr. Dre featuring Eminem. Written by Eminem, the collaboration was released as the second single from Dr. Dre's album 2001 (1999).</p><br>
<p>The song is considered a response to diss tracks by Death Row artists on Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000, a compilation released by Suge Knight that takes its title from Dre's 1992 album The Chronic. Eminem's verse features the bizarre violence and aggression typical of his "Slim Shady" alter ego. In an interview, Kendrick Lamar said this and Six-Two's verse from "Xxplosive" tied for the best verses on 2001.</p><br>
<p>Eminem's lyrics were originally supposed to be performed by Snoop Dogg. Eminem wrote the lyrics, then recorded himself performing them as “reference vocals” for Snoop. Dre liked how it sounded, so he kept Eminem's version in.</p><br>
